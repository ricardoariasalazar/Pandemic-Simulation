# Pandemic-Simulation

In the past, there have been viral disease epidemics (including the 1918 influenza pandemic) which have got out of hand. We would like to simulate the way such diseases spread, to better understand how this happens. In this project we create the necessary data structure to simulate social links and disease transmission between people, simulate infections among the population over a period of time, and plot graphs to determine whether an outbreak is contained or not. The model weâ€™ll use is a simplification of the real world; we will not use actual parameters or consider all important factors.
